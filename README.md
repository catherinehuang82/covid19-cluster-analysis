To view full visualizations, including the world maps with clusters labeled, download notebook.ipynb or view this project on Deepnote: https://deepnote.com/project/Math-22b-Final-Project-7BZSPcsTQPC8EOBp4P2viA/%2Fnotebook.ipynb

## Helpful sources we referenced for data, syntax, and visualizations support:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rbiele02/07_clustering_covid_time_series/blob/master/covid_clustering.ipynb
* Much of our syntax for visualizations (notably map visualizations) came from here
* The article corresponding to this notebook (https://towardsdatascience.com/which-countries-are-affected-the-most-by-covid-19-4d4570852e31) inspired our COVID-19 case study

* Provided helpful syntax on running K-means and GMM using sk-learn
